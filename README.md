# GSS Freight API

Freight API provides programmatic access to GSS functionality and content.

The API is [REST API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer "RESTful")
and uses single token key authentication.
Currently, return format for all endpoints is [JSON](http://json.org/ "JSON").

## FAQ
### What do I need to know before I start using the API?
Got rust on your skills? No worries. Here are the docs you might need to get started:

- HTTPS protocol
- [REST software pattern][]
- Authentication with [OAuth][] (or the official [Beginnerâ€™s Guide][])
- Data serialization with [JSON][] (or see a [quick tutorial][])

### How do I connect to the 500px.com API?
The API is only available to authenticated clients. Clients should authenticate users using [OAuth][]. Once authenticated, you need to request a resource from one of the endpoints using HTTPS. Generally, reading any data is done through a request with GET method. If you want our server to create, update or delete a given resource, POST or PUT methods are required.

### What return formats do you support?
Freight API currently returns data in [JSON](http://json.org/ "JSON") format.

### What kind of authentication is required?
Applications must identify themselves to access any resource.
You need to contact your account manager to obtain a test access key.

### Is there a request rate limit?
Presently there is no rate limiting on the api. We however reserve the right to enforce limits or block calls at our discretion.
