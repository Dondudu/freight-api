## FAQ

### How do I connect to the API?
The API is only available to authenticated clients. Clients should authenticate users using [access_key]. Once authenticated, you need to request a resource from one of the endpoints using HTTP. Generally, reading any data is done through a request with GET method.

### What return formats do you support?
Freight API currently returns data in [JSON](http:/json.org/ "JSON") format.  Some methods may return [XML] data, however we don't actively test for XML compatibility.

### What kind of authentication is required?
Applications must identify themselves to access any resource.
You need to contact your account manager to obtain a test access key.
Every request requires a http header property *ACCESS_KEY*, as well as *SUPPORT_EMAIL*. The Support Email should contain the IT Level contact for the organisation. This will be used to contacting you, should we find your requests need attention.

### Is there a request rate limit?
Presently there is no rate limiting on the api. We however reserve the right to enforce limits or block calls at our discretion.

### Shoud I crack on?
Sure, fire away, however, we do suggest you talk to us, prior to starting so we can understand your requirements and explain how best to use this api.
